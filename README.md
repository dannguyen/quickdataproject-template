# quickdataproject-template

**Dan's template for quickie data-wrangling projects**

Basically like [pydataproject-template](https://github.com/dannguyen/pydataproject-template), but without Python library stuff. Because a lot of projects I'm just writing one-off shell and Python scripts



## Changes

### 2020-08-06

- moved data/archived to ./archive (root-level)
- added scripts/utils for frequently used mylog and myfetch stuff
- changed data/MANIFEST.yaml to data/DATA_MANIFEST.yaml
